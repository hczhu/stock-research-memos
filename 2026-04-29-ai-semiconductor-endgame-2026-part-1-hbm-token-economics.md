- ## AI Semiconductor Endgame 2026 (Part 1)
	- **Subtitle**: New Token Economics Computing Paradigm Shifts from GPU Compute to HBM
	- **Source context**: user-provided article text
	- **Core claim**:
		- in the AI inference era, the top-level KPI is no longer raw compute alone
		- the relevant KPI is token economics: token throughput per unit cost / per unit power, with token speed as the secondary but still critical KPI
		- under the current architecture, the article argues the first principle is:
			- `token throughput = HBM size x HBM bandwidth`
	- **Why the author thinks this cycle is different**:
		- in the CPU era, DRAM sat at the edge of system value creation and upgrades had low marginal utility
		- in the GenAI inference era, HBM directly sets the ceiling for token throughput, so HBM capacity and HBM bandwidth become central rather than auxiliary
		- the article's conclusion is that if NVIDIA wants each generation of GPUs to deliver materially higher token economics, HBM has to keep doubling by generation

- ## Summary
	- The article contrasts the old CPU era with the current GenAI inference era.
	- In the CPU era, DDR speed and capacity were weakly connected to the top-level KPI. CPUs used architectural techniques such as superscalar execution, wider issue, larger ROBs, register renaming, and multiple cache layers to hide memory latency. Most client and cloud workloads also did not require much bandwidth, so DDR upgrades did little for end performance.
	- That is why the article says `DDR3` to `DDR5` took roughly `15 years`, average PC DRAM only grew from about `7-8GB` to around `23GB` over the past `10 years`, and speed upgrades were mostly pricing upgrades rather than major drivers of system utility.
	- The author argues that GenAI changes the objective function. In inference, the system KPI is how many tokens can be produced cheaply and quickly. That shifts the bottleneck from pure compute to memory subsystem performance.
	- The logic chain is:
		- token throughput = batch size x token speed
		- batch size is bottlenecked by HBM size because each concurrent request carries a hot KV cache that must stay resident in HBM
		- token speed is bottlenecked by HBM bandwidth because decode repeatedly reads activated weights and especially KV cache from HBM
		- therefore `token throughput = HBM size x HBM bandwidth` is presented as the hardware first principle
	- The article uses system-scale inference rather than single-GPU inference as the relevant frame. In the `NVL72` era, inference is treated as a system-level token factory composed of `72 GPUs + 36 CPUs`.
	- The example given is Rubin NVL72:
		- average token speed per request: `100 tokens/s`
		- simultaneous requests: `1,920`
		- resulting throughput: `192,000 tokens/s`
		- system power: roughly `120kW` or `0.12MW`
		- resulting throughput density: `1.6M tokens/s per MW`
	- The author argues that sustaining `2x` token throughput growth per generation requires each single GPU generation to improve `HBM size x HBM bandwidth` by `2x`.
	- The conclusion is stronger than simple AI-demand optimism: HBM demand is presented as endogenous to the GPU roadmap itself. In this framing, HBM is no longer a cyclical sidecar to compute but the direct constraint on the GPU's ability to push the Pareto frontier of token throughput and token speed.

- ## Quantitative Data Points

	| Topic | Data point | Value | Context |
	|---|---|---:|---|
	| CPU-era DRAM evolution | DDR generation transition time | `15 years` | The article says `DDR3` to `DDR5` took a full `15 years`. |
	| CPU-era PC DRAM capacity | Starting average PC DDR capacity | `7-8GB` | Approximate average PC memory capacity about a decade ago. |
	| CPU-era PC DRAM capacity | Current average PC DDR capacity | `~23GB` | Approximate average PC memory capacity now. |
	| CPU-era PC DRAM capacity growth | Capacity multiple over a decade | `~3x` | Derived from `7-8GB` to `~23GB` over `10 years`. |
	| CPU-era DRAM impact on performance | Performance uplift from doubling DDR speed | `<20%` | The article says doubling DDR speed generally lifted CPU performance by less than `20%`. |
	| Time reference | PC DRAM growth period | `10 years` | Period over which average PC DDR capacity rose from `7-8GB` to `~23GB`. |
	| System-scale inference configuration | NVL72 GPU count | `72 GPUs` | NVL72 is described as a system-level token factory. |
	| System-scale inference configuration | NVL72 CPU count | `36 CPUs` | CPU count paired with `72 GPUs` in the NVL72 system example. |
	| Rubin NVL72 example | Average token speed per request | `100 tokens/s` | Used in the throughput example. |
	| Rubin NVL72 example | Simultaneous requests | `1,920` | Batch / concurrency assumption in the example. |
	| Rubin NVL72 example | Total token throughput | `192,000 tokens/s` | `1,920 x 100 tokens/s`. |
	| Rubin NVL72 example | Power draw | `~120kW` | Also expressed as `0.12MW`. |
	| Rubin NVL72 example | Power draw | `0.12MW` | Same system power expressed in megawatts. |
	| Rubin NVL72 example | Throughput density | `1.6M tokens/s/MW` | `192,000 tokens/s / 0.12MW`. |
	| KV-cache example | Model layer count | `80 layers` | Example used to explain repeated KV-cache reads from HBM during token generation. |
	| Per-token KV access example | KV reads per token generation step | `80 times` | For the `80-layer` example, each generated token requires reading KV cache `80` times from HBM. |
	| Generational scaling claim | Target token throughput growth per generation | `2x` | The article says maintaining `2x` throughput growth requires `HBM size x HBM bandwidth` to also grow `2x`. |
	| Architecture comparison | Demand dimensions that define the HBM ceiling | `2` | HBM size and HBM bandwidth are the two dimensions the article treats as the ceiling. |

- ## Key Equations And Logic Chain
	- `token throughput = batch size x token speed`
	- `batch size bottleneck -> HBM size`
	- `token speed bottleneck -> HBM bandwidth`
	- therefore:
		- `token throughput = HBM size x HBM bandwidth`
	- The article treats this not as a loose correlation but as a system-optimization necessity under current inference architecture.

- ## Investment Implications
	- The article is structurally bullish on HBM because it argues HBM demand is tied to the GPU roadmap itself, not just to cyclical end-demand swings.
	- In this framing, HBM capacity growth and HBM bandwidth growth both map directly to inference economics, which is why memory content per accelerator should keep rising.
	- The author is implicitly arguing that traditional DRAM-cycle thinking is inadequate for HBM: the relevant question is no longer only whether hyperscaler demand is peaking, but whether the token-economics frontier can keep advancing without continued HBM doubling.

- ## Caveats
	- This is a thesis-driven architecture essay, not an audited industry report.
	- Several statements are conceptual or directional rather than fully benchmarked in the provided text.
	- The claim that NVIDIA token throughput and `HBM size x HBM bandwidth` track closely on log axes is asserted in the article, but no underlying chart values were provided in the text above.
