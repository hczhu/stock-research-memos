- ## Memory Market Size and Big 3 Financials — Data Compilation
	- **Source**: Synthesized from memos in this repo; primary sources include Morgan Stanley, Epoch AI, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Gartner; Big 3 annual and quarterly earnings reports (2025–Q1 2026)
	- **Unit note**: HBM volume rows below are in mn GB (gigabytes). Raw source data is in Gb (gigabits); divided by 8 to convert. ASP derived from HBM market size ÷ HBM demand volume in GB.

- ## Table 0: Memory Market and Big 3 Revenue Overview

	| Metric | 2025 | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E |
	|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
	| **Big 3 combined memory revenue ($B)** | **$178** | **$439¹** | n/a | n/a |
	| Big 3 revenue growth YoY | +35% | +147%¹ | n/a | n/a |
	| Total memory market size ($B) | $220 | $890 | n/a | n/a |
	| **HBM market size ($B)** | **$31.5** | **~$70²** | **$116** | **$168** |
	| HBM volume demand — MS (mn GB) | 2,440 | 4,276 | 7,011 | n/a |
	| HBM volume demand — UBS (mn GB) | 2,188 | 4,113 | 7,250 | n/a |
	| HBM volume supply — MS (mn GB) | 2,846 | 4,375 | 6,730 | n/a |
	| HBM volume supply — UBS (mn GB) | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
	| HBM ASP ($/GB) | $14.4 | ~$17.0 | ~$16.0 | n/a |

	- **¹ 2026E Big 3 revenue**: Annualized from Q1 2026 × 4 (SK Hynix $35.5B + Samsung $50.5B + Micron $23.9B = $109.9B/quarter). Likely understates full year if prices continue rising through H2 2026
	- **Big 3 2025 breakdown**: SK Hynix FY2025 $68B (KRW 97.15T, +50% YoY); Samsung memory FY2025 $73B (KRW 104.1T, +23% YoY); Micron FY2025 (FYE Sep) $37B (+49% YoY)
	- **Big 3 2024 base** (for growth calc): SK Hynix ~$45B, Samsung memory ~$62B, Micron $25B → total ~$132B
	- **² HBM 2026E market size**: ~$70B is a midpoint estimate; Goldman Sachs revised 2027E to $116B (from $75B prior) in June 2026, implying ~$65–75B for 2026E by interpolation
	- **HBM 2027E/2028E**: Goldman Sachs June 2026 forecast (revised up from $75B/$100B prior estimates)
	- **Total memory 2025/2026E**: Morgan Stanley Chipflation report June 2, 2026; $890B is full-year 2026E forecast (not annualized Q1), +71% upward revision from prior $520B estimate
	- **HBM ASP**: Derived as HBM market size ÷ UBS demand (converted from Gb to GB ÷ 8); 2025: $31.5B / 2,188 mn GB = $14.4/GB; 2027E: $116B / 7,250 mn GB = $16.0/GB
	- **UBS supply**: UBS did not publish HBM supply-side forecasts in available memos

- ## Table 0b: Big 3 Implied Combined Market Cap by P/S Multiple

	- Bull-case framing: if 2026 combined Big 3 memory revenue reaches **$800B**, the implied combined market cap at various price-to-sales (P/S) multiples is:

	| P/S Ratio | 2026E Memory Revenue ($B) | Implied Combined Market Cap ($T) | vs. Current ~$3.5T |
	|---:|---:|---:|---:|
	| 4× | $800 | $3.2T | −9% |
	| **5×** | **$800** | **$4.0T** | **+14%** |
	| 6× | $800 | $4.8T | +37% |
	| 8× | $800 | $6.4T | +83% |
	| 10× | $800 | $8.0T | +129% |

	- **$800B revenue scenario**: A bull case above the $439B Q1-annualized figure in Table 0 — assumes prices keep climbing through H2 2026 and full-year revenue runs well ahead of the Q1 run-rate
	- **Current combined market cap**: The three companies are together worth ~$3.5T as of June 2026
	- **5× P/S as a conservative anchor**: Even a conservative 5× multiple implies ~$4.0T combined — ~14% above the current ~$3.5T, suggesting modest upside if the revenue scenario plays out and multiples hold
	- **Caveat — Samsung is not a pure play**: Samsung's market cap includes non-memory businesses (foundry, mobile, displays, consumer electronics). Applying a memory-revenue P/S to Samsung's full market cap overstates the memory-attributable multiple; the table is a blunt aggregate, not a clean per-company valuation
	- **Caveat — cyclicality**: Memory is deeply cyclical; peak-cycle revenue should command a lower P/S than the table's flat multiples imply. The market typically de-rates memory names as the cycle approaches its top, anticipating the downturn

- ## Table 1: Server Memory Market Size ($ Billion)

	| Segment | 2024 | 2025 | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E |
	|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
	| HBM | $12.1B | $31.5B | ~$60–75B† | ~$110–130B† | n/a |
	| Server DRAM (non-HBM) | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
	| **Total server memory** | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
	| **Total memory (all)** | n/a | **$220B** | **$890B** | n/a | n/a |

	- **HBM 2024/2025**: Epoch AI; tracks HBM spend across NVIDIA, AMD, Google, Amazon chips (all major HBM buyers — effectively total HBM market). Q4 2025 alone = $11.0B, implying ~$44B+ annualized run rate entering 2026
	- **HBM 2026E/2027E (†)**: Derived from UBS volume model (+88% YoY in 2026E, +76% in 2027E) applied to 2025 base, with modest ASP compression assumed. Not directly sourced from a memo dollar figure
	- **Total memory $220B/$890B**: Morgan Stanley Chipflation report (June 2, 2026); $890B reflects a +71% upward revision in just 3 months from a prior $520B estimate; includes all memory types globally
	- **Server DRAM dollar market**: Not available in current memos. Volume data available: commodity DRAM demand 316,640 mn Gb (2025) → 469,675 mn Gb (2026E) → 619,970 mn Gb (2027E) per Morgan Stanley, of which server's share of DRAM bit demand rises from 37% (2023) → 59% (2028E)

- ## HBM Volume Demand (mn Gb) — Morgan Stanley / UBS

	| Source | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026E | 2027E |
	|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
	| Morgan Stanley (demand) | 1,866 | 9,059 | 19,516 | 34,205 | 56,085 |
	| Morgan Stanley (supply) | 3,150 | 11,436 | 22,765 | 34,997 | 53,837 |
	| UBS (demand, bn GB) | — | — | 17.5 | 32.9 | 58.0 |
	| UBS YoY growth | — | — | — | +88% | +76% |

	- MS and UBS figures broadly consistent; slight differences reflect model vintage and methodology
	- HBM supply and demand converge in 2026E and reverse (demand > supply) by 2027E per MS model

- ## Big 3 Capital Expenditure ($ Billion)

	| Vendor | 2024 | 2025 | 2026E | 2025 Growth | 2026E Growth |
	|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
	| Samsung | $33.0B | $33.4B | $40.0B | +1% | +20% |

- ## HBM Production Share by Vendor (Implied from MS Exhibit 30)

	| Vendor | 2025 Production (mn Gb) | Share | 2027E Production (mn Gb) | Share |
	|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
	| SK Hynix | 12,830 | 56% | 22,226 | 41% |
	| Samsung | 6,387 | 28% | 21,239 | 40% |
	| Micron | 3,548 | 16% | 10,372 | 19% |
	| **Total** | **22,765** | 100% | **53,837** | 100% |

	- SK Hynix leads in 2025 on volume share, driven by superior yield (75%) and UTR (100%)
	- Samsung and SK Hynix converge by 2027E as Samsung recovers UTR to 100% and yield to 70%
	- Micron grows fastest proportionally but remains smallest in absolute volume

- ## Remaining Data Gaps
	- **HBM revenue by vendor**: None of the Big 3 disclose HBM revenue separately; it is embedded in DRAM; approximate shares can be inferred from production volume data (Table 4 above)
	- **Server vs. consumer DRAM split**: Not broken out by any vendor in public filings; must be estimated using DRAM share of shipments from industry reports (e.g., Morgan Stanley, IDC)
	- **Samsung DRAM vs. NAND revenue**: Samsung reports memory as a single line; DRAM/NAND split not separately disclosed (unlike SK Hynix, where NAND is attributed to a separate business unit)
	- **Server DRAM dollar TAM**: Requires a Gartner / IDC / IHS Markit market sizing report — not currently in memos
	- **2028 HBM forecast**: MS and UBS models end at 2027E
