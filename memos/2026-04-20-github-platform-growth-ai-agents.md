- ## GitHub Platform Growth — Commits & Actions (2023–2026)
	- **Source**: GitHub internal operational metrics, shared publicly (attributed to GitHub leadership commentary on AI-agent-driven platform activity), April 2026
	- **Context**: GitHub is experiencing an inflection in platform activity driven by AI coding agents (Copilot, third-party agentic workflows) that commit and run CI/CD pipelines autonomously, compounding on top of human developer growth. The data below captures both the scale and acceleration.
- ## Commit Volume
  
  | Period | Commits | Notes |
  |--------|--------:|-------|
  | Full year 2025 | 1 billion | Annual total |
  | Current run rate (Apr 2026) | 275 million / week | ~14 billion/year at linear extrapolation |
  | Implied YoY growth (linear) | ~14× | 1B (2025 full year) → 14B (2026 annualized) |
	- **Caveat**: "spoiler: it won't" — the source acknowledges linear extrapolation overstates; growth rate likely moderates as base grows.
	- **Key insight**: Weekly run rate of 275M commits (Apr 2026) already exceeds the entire 2025 annual total of 1B in ~3.6 weeks, implying the acceleration happened largely in early-to-mid 2026.
- ## GitHub Actions (CI/CD Compute Minutes)
  
  | Period | Minutes / Week | Notes |
  |--------|---------------:|-------|
  | 2023 | 500 million | Baseline |
  | 2025 | 1 billion | 2× in ~2 years |
  | Apr 2026 (current week) | 2.1 billion | 2.1× vs. 2025 in ~1 year |
  | Cumulative growth (2023→2026) | ~4.2× | |
	- **Growth cadence**: First doubling took ~2 years (2023→2025); second doubling took ~1 year (2025→2026), suggesting acceleration is compressing.
	- **Driver**: AI agents running automated test/build/deploy pipelines on every generated commit dramatically increase CI minutes per human developer.
- ## Infrastructure Response
	- GitHub is investing heavily in scaling compute (more CPUs), scaling backend services, and hardening core platform features to keep pace with agentic workloads.
	- This signals that AI-agent-generated activity is already material to GitHub's infrastructure cost base — and by extension Microsoft Azure (which hosts GitHub infrastructure).
- ## Investment Implications
	- **[[$MSFT]] (MSFT)**: GitHub is wholly owned by Microsoft. Platform growth at this scale directly reinforces the GitHub Copilot monetization story (more developers → more seats) and accelerates Azure consumption (GitHub Actions runs on Azure compute). The Actions compute growth (+4.2× since 2023) is a direct Azure revenue signal.
	- **AI coding agent flywheel**: More commits → more CI runs → more compute consumed → more Copilot suggestions generated → more commits. GitHub becomes a compounding demand driver for both AI inference (Copilot) and cloud compute (Actions).
	- **Competitive moat**: The network effects of commit history, pull requests, and Actions pipelines embedded in GitHub strengthen the platform's stickiness as AI agents proliferate. Alternative platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket) face the same agent-driven volume but with smaller installed bases.
	- **Risk**: Infrastructure cost scale-up could pressure margins if compute cost growth outpaces revenue growth from seats/consumption; "it won't stay linear" acknowledgment suggests the source expects a deceleration.
