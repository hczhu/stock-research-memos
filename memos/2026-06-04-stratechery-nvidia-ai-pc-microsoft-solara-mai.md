- ## Stratechery (Ben Thompson) — The Nvidia AI PC, Project Solara, and Microsoft AI
	- **Source**: Stratechery by Ben Thompson, covering Computex + Microsoft Build keynotes, June 2026
	- **Thesis**: Three announcements (Nvidia's PC chip, Microsoft's Project Solara, Microsoft's in-house MAI models) reveal a key divide — local AI inference on devices is a fading bet, while the cloud-as-hub agent model and enterprise-owned models are where the value is migrating. "In the age of AI, thin is in."
- ## 1. The Nvidia AI PC (RTX Spark / N1X)
	- **What it is**: Nvidia's entry into the PC main-processor market, long ruled by Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple. Built with Microsoft; debuts fall 2026 on Windows PCs from Microsoft, Dell, HP, ASUS, Lenovo, MSI
	- **Strategic significance**: World's most valuable company (won via data-center AI chips) now expanding into the PC SoC arena — a new front in the compute wars
	  
	  | RTX Spark (N1X) spec | Value |
	  |---|---|
	  | CPU | Up to 20 Arm cores |
	  | GPU | Blackwell, 6,144 CUDA cores |
	  | RAM | 128 GB LPDDR5X |
	  | Memory bandwidth | Up to 300 GB/s |
	  | Interconnect | NVLink C2C (CPU↔GPU) |
	  | Target workload | AI agents, 120B-param models, 1M-token context |
	- **Performance read (vs. DGX Spark proxy)**: Good at prefill; slower than M5 Max at decode (lower memory bandwidth); significantly slower at CPU tasks
	- **Ben Thompson's critique — the chip is mis-architected for the current AI era**:
	  
	  | AI Era | Key bottleneck | Implication for local hardware |
	  |---|---|---|
	  | ChatGPT era (~2023) | Local inference exciting | Local GPU made sense |
	  | Reasoning era | KV cache explosion → more memory; decode matters | Bandwidth/memory-bound; cloud wins |
	  | Agentic era (now) | **CPU performance** is critical | Need strong local CPU + cloud inference |
	- **Core argument**: The ideal local-agent setup is **strong local CPU + call out to cloud for inference**. RTX Spark instead spends die area on GPU cores that are inferior to the cloud (memory size/bandwidth) at the expense of CPU. "A suitable chip if you just want a chatbot circa 2023" — hard to justify the price or the Windows-on-ARM software compromises in 2026
	- **Read on Nadella**: His underwhelming, Windows-focused Build open suggests he quietly agrees — "that's not where the AI that matters is going to be located." Nadella has no loyalty to Windows; he ended Windows as Microsoft's organizing principle in favor of "software that runs everywhere and a cloud that runs everything"
- ## 2. Project Solara — Microsoft's agent-era device platform
	- **What it is**: A Microsoft platform for **devices that run AI agents instead of apps**, based on **Android (not Windows)**, using off-the-shelf components for fast/cheap device development. Two working hardware designs; enterprise pilots lined up
	- **Status**: Vaporware (real devices shown, but not shipping); **Qualcomm and MediaTek signed as chip partners**
	- **Focus**: **Enterprise, not consumer**
	- **Product/architecture direction**:
		- **Agents replace apps** — use agents to avoid the constraints of traditional software
		- **"Outside AI" application structure** (Bathiche, from Build 2023): AI moves from operating *within an app frame* to operating *globally* across multiple apps/services — connecting, coordinating, and maintaining context across workflows, devices, and time
		- **Constellation-of-devices model**: "The next computer is not one device" — a system that extends your agent across many devices, with agents showing up close to where/when needed
	- **The key insight (cloud-as-hub, not phone-as-hub)**:
		- Wearables' flaw: useful only when the human is in the loop, which is "annoying and inefficient"
		- Solara's demo: brief human interaction → **agent does the work in the background in the cloud**, no human needed in the loop
		- **Better topology for agents**: cloud is the hub, devices are spokes — instead of the phone at the center. "Agents work best in the cloud, and across apps and devices; the phone might be one device, but it shouldn't be the hub"
	- **Why this fits Microsoft**: Microsoft doesn't control a phone (no iPhone equivalent), so a cloud-hub device model plays to its strengths — context and compute already live in the cloud for enterprises. Classic Microsoft hook: new tech (agents) → new form factors → **new platform Microsoft controls**
	- **Caveat**: Vaporware and very much in Microsoft's self-interest — but the cloud-hub-for-agents vision "is clearly a better one for agents," even if Solara itself fails
- ## 3. Microsoft AI — MAI models + Frontier Tuning
	- **What it is**: Microsoft AI Superintelligence Team unveiled **7 in-house models built from scratch**, reducing reliance on OpenAI and Anthropic (partners/rivals with "competing allegiances")
	- **Flagship — MAI-Thinking-1** (reasoning model):
		- Draws even with **Claude Sonnet 4.6** in blind human testing
		- Matches **Claude Opus 4.6** on a widely-used coding benchmark
		- **Trained from scratch, no distillation** from other models → appeals to enterprises caring about **clean data lineage**
	- **Business model — Microsoft Frontier Tuning (the real product)**:
		- Lets enterprises **customize MAI models** with their own data via the "full-stack hill-climbing machine"
		- Built on **RLEs (reinforcement learning environments)** — task/company-specific "training gyms" that adapt agents only to you
		- **The moat pitch**: "You don't rent intelligence from a shared model that learns from everybody." Only you keep the benefits of your workflows, know-how, and institutional data; only you control the resulting model. **"The RLEs and the models you build become your moat."**
		  
		  | Frontier Tuning proof point | Result |
		  |---|---|
		  | MAI tuned on Excel agentic tasks | On par with GPT 5.4 (public + private benchmarks), **10× more cost-efficient** |
		  | MAI tuned on McKinsey's tasks | Highest win rate, beat GPT 5.5, **10× more cost-efficient** |
	- **Comparison**: Shades of **AWS Nova Forge** (enterprises add data at a pre-training checkpoint); MAI is more RL-focused, but the lines between pretraining-customization and RL-tuning are blurring
	- **The bet & the risk**: Enterprises get their own model on their own data without feeding the frontier labs that "want to eat their lunch." Appealing in theory — **the real test is whether enterprises that choose this route get penalized for not being on the cutting edge** of functionality
	- **Why it suits Microsoft**: "Helping cautious enterprises embrace the future on their terms, without necessarily winning on pure performance, is exactly how Microsoft has long maintained its position"
- ## Cross-Cutting Insights & Investment Implications
	- **Local inference is a fading bet; the cloud is where AI value concentrates**: Across all three stories, the through-line is that agent-era AI lives in the cloud. Bearish read on "AI PC" premium pricing (Nvidia RTX Spark, Windows-on-ARM); the device's job shrinks to capture + light local CPU + cloud calls
	- **"Thin is in"**: Devices get thinner/dumber as intelligence moves to the cloud; value migrates from the endpoint to the cloud platform and the agent layer
	- **Chip-architecture signal**: For agentic workloads, **CPU > local GPU** on-device. Mis-allocating die to local GPU (RTX Spark) is the wrong bet — relevant for evaluating Nvidia's PC push vs. Apple (M-series CPU strength), Qualcomm, MediaTek
	- **Qualcomm & MediaTek as agent-device winners**: Both signed as Solara chip partners — positions them in the post-PC, Android-based agent-device supply chain (note: MediaTek's AI-infra/ASIC pivot is a recurring theme — see [[2026-03-28-mediatek-google-orders-and-broadcom-share-shift-2026-02]] and [[mediatek-mtk]] thesis)
	- **Microsoft's platform reflex**: Twice over (Solara platform, Frontier Tuning) Microsoft is trying to own the new control point — devices→cloud platform, and models→enterprise tuning layer. Consistent with its post-Windows "cloud that runs everything" strategy
	- **Enterprise-owned-models thesis (vs. frontier labs)**: A structural counter-positioning against OpenAI/Anthropic — sell enterprises a model *they own and control* rather than rented shared intelligence. Bullish for hyperscalers' platform lock-in (Microsoft, AWS Nova Forge); a potential headwind for frontier labs' enterprise TAM if data-lineage/control concerns dominate over raw capability
