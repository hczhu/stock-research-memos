- ## HBM Share Of AI Chip Component Spend
	- **Source**:
		- user-provided screenshot from `Epoch AI | CC-BY`
		- accurate source data added in `data/ai-chip-component-cost-shares-by-quarter.csv`
		- chart title: `Average share of total component cost`
		- screenshot text says the estimates are averages across AI chips designed by `Nvidia`, `AMD`, `Google`, and `Amazon`, weighted by production volume
	- **Context**:
		- the chart splits AI chip component spending into `Memory`, `Logic`, `Packaging`, and `Auxiliary`
		- the key message is that HBM is taking more of the AI chip bill of materials while packaging and auxiliary shares fall
		- the screenshot states HBM grew from `52%` to `63%` of total AI chip component spending between `Q1 2024` and `Q4 2025`
	- **Caveat**:
		- quarterly component shares and dollar costs come from the CSV source data
		- screenshot text is used for qualitative context and hyperscaler capex comments

- ## NVL72 Rack-Level BOM: Memory Share by GPU Generation (Exhibit 46)
	- **Source**: Morgan Stanley Research estimates
	- **Headline**: Memory will exceed 25% of the NVL72 rack BOM for Rubin (VR200) — up from 7% on GB200 — as HBM price inflation combines with higher per-GPU HBM content

	| Component | GB200 NVL72 | GB300 NVL72 | VR200 NVL72 |
	|---|---:|---:|---:|
	| GPU | 65% | 63% | 51% |
	| Memory | 7% | 9% | **26%** |
	| Other networking chips | 5% | 7% | 7% |
	| CPU | 5% | 5% | 3% |
	| NVLink Switch chip | 2% | 2% | 2% |
	| Cooling | 2% | 2% | 1% |
	| Power supply | 1% | 1% | 1% |
	| PCB | 1% | 1% | 1% |
	| Others | 11% | 10% | 8% |
	| Rack assembly value add | 1% | 1% | 0% |
	| ABF Substrate | 0% | 0% | 0% |
	| MLCC | 0% | 0% | 0% |

	- Memory's rack BOM share: **7% (GB200) → 9% (GB300) → 26% (VR200)** — a 3.7× increase across two GPU generations
	- GPU's rack BOM share compresses from 65% → 51% as memory inflation dilutes compute's dominance in total system cost
	- The VR200 data point (26%) aligns with the Exhibit 30 figure cited elsewhere: memory jumped from 9.4% (GB300) to 25.7% (VR200) per Morgan Stanley estimates
	- This is a rack-level complement to the chip-level data above: at the chip level HBM is 63% of component cost; at the rack level it is 26% of total system BOM — both moving in the same direction

- ## Stock Implications
	- The component mix shift is directly bullish for `HBM` suppliers because memory is becoming a larger share of AI accelerator cost, not just growing with unit volumes.
	- The jump from roughly `$12B` of HBM spend in `2024` to `$32B` in `2025` suggests both volume growth and pricing / mix uplift.
	- Logic share staying roughly flat near `13%` means the marginal cost pressure in AI accelerators is not only about compute dies.
	- Packaging remains strategically important, but its share falling from `19%` to `15%` implies HBM is absorbing more of the bill-of-materials expansion.
	- The capex comments from `Microsoft` and `Meta` tie component inflation directly into hyperscaler budget revisions, which matters for cloud gross margins and AI infrastructure supply-chain pricing power.

- ## Memo Takeaway
	- The chart's core point is that HBM is becoming the dominant and still-growing cost bucket inside leading AI chips.
	- For stock work, this supports a memory-cycle thesis where HBM demand is driven by three forces at once:
		- AI chip unit growth
		- higher HBM content per chip
		- tight memory supply and rising component prices
