- ## Token Throughput per GPU vs. Interactivity
	- **Source context**:
		- chart title: `Token Throughput per GPU vs. Interactivity`
		- model / test setup shown: `DeepSeek R1 0528 · FP4, FP8 · 8K / 1K`
		- source shown in chart: `SemiAnalysis InferenceMAX™`
		- update date shown in chart: `02/14/2026`
	- **What the chart is showing**:
		- `y-axis`: token throughput per GPU (`tok/s/GPU`)
		- `x-axis`: interactivity (`toks/user`)
		- the chart compares newer `GB200/GB300 NVL72` inference systems against an `H100 Disagg+WideEP FP8` baseline
	- **Important caveat**:
		- the screenshot does not expose hover tooltips or raw exported data
		- the tables below therefore separate:
			- exact values explicitly printed on the chart
			- approximate curve points visually read from the screenshot
		- the small numeric labels next to points are preserved as shown where possible, but the screenshot does not define what those labels represent

- ## Context For The Data Points
	- The chart’s basic message is that `GB200/GB300 NVL72` systems deliver materially higher token throughput per GPU than the `H100 Disagg+WideEP FP8` baseline, especially at low-to-mid interactivity.
	- The orange callouts (`20.2x`, `79.3x`, `100.5x`) are the cleanest explicit comparison datapoints in the screenshot and indicate very large throughput advantages at selected operating points.
	- All visible curves slope downward as interactivity rises, which implies that throughput per GPU falls as workloads become more interactive and less batch-friendly.
	- The `FP4` NVL72 curve is the highest visible family, the `FP8` NVL72 curve sits below it, and the `H100` baseline is much lower still.
	- At the far right of the chart, the gap narrows in absolute throughput terms because all systems are operating in a much more interactive regime where batching efficiency is weaker.

- ## Interpretation
	- The chart is supportive of the view that `GB200/GB300 NVL72` systems materially improve inference economics and utilization relative to older `H100`-class disaggregated setups.
	- The largest gains appear in workloads where the system can still preserve some batching / throughput efficiency rather than operating in the most latency-sensitive regime.
	- For the memory and networking stack, this type of chart is indirectly bullish because the advantage is being expressed at the system level, not just at raw chip spec level.
