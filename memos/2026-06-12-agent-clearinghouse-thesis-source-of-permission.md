- ## The Agent Clearinghouse — From "Source of Truth" to "Source of Permission"
	- **Source**: VC blog post (likely Menlo or similar). Expands on an earlier (Dec 2025) post about "the fight to become the front door to systems of record."
	- **Core thesis**: In the SaaS era, **systems of record** (Salesforce, Workday, NetSuite) had the deepest moats. In the AI era, the equivalent prize is becoming **The Clearinghouse for agents** — the layer that controls memory, context, execution, and governance for all autonomous agents in an enterprise. This moat may be *deeper* than systems of record because it controls permissions, not just data.

- ## SaaS Era: Why Systems of Record Won
	- Goal every SaaS company aspired to: store and govern critical data, own where workflows kicked off or touched
	- Winners: Salesforce (customer data), Workday (employee data), NetSuite (financial data)
	- Moat mechanism: hundreds of independent workflows and solutions built on top → ripping out the foundational layer was nearly impossible
	- Switching costs compounded yearly; price increases, mediocre product velocity, difficult upgrades didn't matter — the data was in there, the workflows were built around it

- ## AI Era: The Clearinghouse Thesis
	- Enterprise is heading toward: agents from many vendors, acting autonomously, touching critical data, spending real money
	- Someone must sit in the middle and decide: which agent is cleared to act? On what data? With what limits? And prove what happened after the fact
	- **The Clearinghouse controls four things:**

	| Layer | What it governs |
	|---|---|
	| Memory | What your agents know |
	| Context | What they see and how it's served |
	| Execution | What they're allowed to do |
	| Governance | Who's allowed to do what + audit trail |

	- A system of record controlled your data. The Clearinghouse controls your **permissions** — migrating off the thing that holds your policies, permissions, and entire audit history is probably harder than migrating off a system of record
	- Agent clearinghouses will start to look like systems of record themselves — but for agent traces, evals, telemetry, A/B data (not transactional data)

- ## Governance as Strategic Real Estate
	- Governance used to be a compliance checkbox at the end of the sales cycle
	- Now: CIOs focus on it from meeting #1 — "can I see what every agent did, set policy on what it can touch, and prove it to my auditors?"
	- The buying question shifts from "is the model good?" (every model is good enough) to "can I govern this?"
	- Examples: Databricks leads with evaluation + governance; KPMG wrapping Microsoft Agent 365 in "Trusted AI" framework — they are **selling clearance**

- ## Who Is Racing for the Clearinghouse Seat

	| Player | Strategy | Angle |
	|---|---|---|
	| Snowflake, Databricks | Win from below | Data gravity → clearing gravity (agents must come to where data lives) |
	| Microsoft (Agent 365 + Copilot) | Win from above | Own the surface where employees kick off agents |
	| Agent-native startups | Win from the middle | Argue an entirely new layer emerges |

	- All are right about one thing: whoever wins defines the knowledge graph, the governance frameworks, and which workflows get automated first

- ## Paths for Startups
	1. **Vertical clearinghouse**: Earn clearinghouse status in an industry the horizontal players won't go deep on — proprietary data, regulatory complexity, workflow depth they can't absorb from outside
	2. **Clearinghouse across clearinghouses**: Govern the multi-vendor mess (parallel: multi-cloud). Set policy across all agent vendors, clear actions across all of them, hold the audit trail. The incumbents can't credibly be neutral here (Microsoft governing Salesforce's agents? Good luck). The neutral seat is a strategic position

- ## Key Takeaway
	- "The lock-in just moves from your data to your permissions. The source-of-truth era is transitioning into the **source-of-permission era**."
	- In 18 months there won't be room to be undecided on your path to the clearinghouse

- ## Investment Implications
	- Bullish for: $SNOW, $DBR (Databricks) if they successfully extend data gravity into agent governance; $MSFT if Copilot/Agent 365 becomes the default clearing surface
	- Bearish for: Pure-play agent builders that don't control governance — they become features that clear through someone else's infrastructure

	- Watch: which companies accumulate agent audit trails first — that data becomes the new lock-in
