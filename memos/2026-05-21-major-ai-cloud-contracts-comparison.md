- ## Major AI Cloud Contracts Comparison
	- **Source context**:
		- screenshot titled `Major AI Cloud Contracts`
		- the table appears to compare large AI infrastructure contracts across CoreWeave, Cerebras, GCP, IREN, Nscale, OCI, and Nebius
		- visible rows cover announcement date, contract value, term, implied annual revenue, chip type, critical IT power contracted, disclosed GPU capex, and several derived margin views
	- **Readability note**:
		- most cells are legible from the screenshot, but a few cells are partially obscured or visually ambiguous
		- where a number is not clearly readable, I keep it as `-`
		- where a number is economically obvious from the visible row set, I note that it is inferred

- ## Notes Visible In The Screenshot
	- AI Nvidia clusters assume a `3.4 year` InfiniBand network.
	- Prepayment assumptions are shown in red, with prepayments credited equally throughout contract life.
	- `1.` Option to increase contract value to `~$19.4B`.
	- `2.` Option to add further `700MW` in late `2027`.
	- `3.` IREN disclosed `200MW` of critical IT power, with remaining capacity likely reserved for other non-AI compute that supports this cluster in some form.
	- `4.` The `Cerebras-OpenAI` contract value of `$27.6B` accounts for RPO of `$24.6B` for `750MW` of inference compute, includes full colo pass-through on the first `250MW`, and adds back full colo pass-through on the remaining `500MW`; the screenshot also notes an assumed net of OpenAI warrant contra-revenue and says it assumes `CS.3` systems only.

- ## Context For The Data Points
	- The table is useful because it normalizes a set of headline AI infrastructure deals into a common frame: dollars, term, annualized revenue, chip platform, contracted power, and rough margin profile.
	- The largest visible contract values are `GCP-Anthropic` at `$42.0B`, `OCI-OpenAI` at `$30.0B`, and `Cerebras-OpenAI` at `$27.6B`.
	- On a power basis, the largest visible contracted cluster in the screenshot is `GCP-Anthropic` at `788MW`, followed by `Cerebras-OpenAI` at `750MW`.
	- The table suggests that similar contract values can still map to very different economics depending on chip type, depreciation treatment, and whether pass-through items are included.
	- The `OCI-OpenAI` row stands out because it appears to include two scenarios in the derived margin rows and a separate disclosed GPU capex figure of `4,500` in the source table.
	- The `Nebius-Microsoft` row stands out for weak year-1 economics under deal-term depreciation, with the screenshot showing `-2.5%` EBIT margin before improving under alternative depreciation assumptions.
	- Because this is a screenshot extraction rather than a source spreadsheet, the memo should be treated as a transcription of visible values, not a clean primary dataset.
