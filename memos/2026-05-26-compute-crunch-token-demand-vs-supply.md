- ## Is a Compute Crunch Coming? Token Demand vs Supply Analysis
	- **Source**: Gradient Updates (Epoch AI) — "Is a compute crunch coming?", Luke Emberson and Jaime Sevilla, May 26, 2026
	- **Thesis**: Global token demand is growing ~10×/year while supply grows ~3.4×/year; a compute crunch for large-model inference is likely near, particularly for long-context agentic workloads.

- ## Investment Implications
	- Demand growing ~10×/yr vs supply ~3.4×/yr implies persistent pricing power for inference compute — bullish for NVIDIA and HBM suppliers (SK Hynix, Micron)
	- Long-context agentic workloads (coding agents) are the most bandwidth-constrained — HBM density and bandwidth are the limiting resource, not raw FLOP/s
	- Anthropic already managing demand via quotas and off-peak incentives — confirms supply is binding at the frontier
	- Efficiency gains (speculative decoding, MLA, FP4) are real but ~2× in magnitude; they slow but do not close the 3× annual demand/supply gap
	- Small models benefit structurally: as large-model tokens get priced up, everyday use cases shift to cheaper models — not a regression in user capability given rapid small-model improvement
	- Per-GPU calibrated throughput is ~60% of theoretical (400K vs 640K tok/s) — real-world deployments underperform datasheets substantially, primarily due to bandwidth inefficiency and inter-GPU communication
