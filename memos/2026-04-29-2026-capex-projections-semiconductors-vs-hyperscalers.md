- ## 2026 Capex Projections: Semiconductor Companies vs Hyperscalers
	- **Source memos**:

	- **Scope**:
		- this memo charts `2026` capex projections for named semiconductor companies and the US Big 4 hyperscalers
		- all figures are in **US$ billions**
	- **Method**:
		- semiconductor figures are direct `2026` company values from the semiconductor capex memo
		- hyperscaler figures use low/high ranges where ranges were provided
		- single-point hyperscaler figures are shown as the same value on both the low and high series
		- segment totals and `Others` rows are excluded so the chart focuses on named companies

- ## Quick Comparisons
	- The hyperscaler spending scale is an order of magnitude larger than individual semiconductor-company capex.
	- Even the lowest Big 4 hyperscaler in the range, [[$META]] at `US$125B`, is still more than `2x` [[$TSM]]'s `US$54B` projected capex.
	- [[$AMZN]] plus [[$MSFT]] alone imply roughly `US$390B` of `2026` capex, which exceeds the full `US$200B` `2026` semiconductor-industry total shown in the semiconductor memo.
	- Within semiconductors, [[$TSM]], [[$005930.KS]], [[$000660.KS]], and [[$MU]] are the dominant named capex spenders in the source dataset.

- ## 2027 Hyperscaler Capex Outlook — Consensus vs Bull Case
	- **Source**: user-provided estimate; argues consensus 2027 hyperscaler capex is **too conservative**.
	- All figures aggregate **total hyperscaler** capex (broader than the Big-4-only ~`US$695-725B` 2026 base in [[2026-04-29-us-big-4-tech-capex-projections-2026]]).

	| Scenario | 2027 hyperscaler capex | YoY growth | Basis |
	|---|---:|---:|---|
	| Consensus (analyst estimates) | **~$920B** | **+22%** | Implies a sharp deceleration from **+84% in 2026** |
	| Bull case (this estimate) | **~$1.1T** | **+45%** | Incremental investment reaching **2-3% of GDP**, similar to the railroad and auto build-outs |

	- **Implied 2026 base ≈ $754-759B** (consistent across both scenarios: $920B ÷ 1.22 ≈ $754B; $1.1T ÷ 1.45 ≈ $759B), itself up ~84% on 2025 (~$410B).
	- **The debate is the growth rate, not the level**: consensus has 2027 growth collapsing to +22% right after a +84% 2026; the bull case says a GDP-anchored build-out keeps growth near +45%, a **~$180B gap** ($1.1T vs $920B) in a single year.
	- **Read-through**: a +45% vs +22% 2027 outcome is the swing factor under the AI-infra/memory demand theses — the difference between a decelerating and a still-accelerating capex cycle ([[2026-05-24-ai-data-center-buildout-capacity-and-spend-scenario]], [[2026-06-10-morgan-stanley-hyperscaler-capex-accounting-risk]]).

- ## Caveats
	- The two source memos do not represent the same economic layer: one tracks semiconductor manufacturers, the other tracks cloud / platform operators.
	- Hyperscaler figures include broader data center and infrastructure spending, not just chip-related capex.
	- [[$META]] and [[$GOOGL]] are ranges; the chart shows both low and high values rather than forcing a midpoint.
